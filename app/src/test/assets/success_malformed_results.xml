    <Lyric>
        Hello Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone home? Come on,
        now. I hear you’re feeling down. Well I can ease your pain, Get you on your feet again.
        Relax. I need some information first. Just the basic facts: Can you show me where it hurts?
        There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship smoke on the horizon. You are only coming
        through in waves. Your lips move but I can’t hear what you’re sayin’. When I was a child I
        had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I got that feeling once again. I
        can’t explain, you would not understand. This is not how I am. I have become comfortably
        numb. Ok. Just a little pinprick. There’ll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh! But you may feel a
        little sick. Can you stand up? I do believe it’s working. good. That’ll keep you going for
        the show. Come on it’s time to go. There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship’s
        smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can’t hear
        what you’re sayin’. When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse, Out of the corner of my
        eye. I turned to look but it was gone. I cannot put my finger on it now. The child is grown,
        the dream is gone. I have become comfortably numb.
